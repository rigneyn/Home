		<h3>The Basics</h3>
		<p class="sansserif">
			To get better at the game, you have to master the basics first.
			To move use the left stick and press it down to sprint. The right
			allows you to look around and pressing it down activates a melee 
			action. To aim down the sights of the weapon (ads), press the left 
			trigger. The right trigger allows you to shoot from the gun. To 
			throw tactical and lethal grenades, press down the top left trigger,
			and the top right trigger. On the right side of the controller, the 
			triangle button switches the weapon you are using, the square one 
			reloads your weaponthe "x" button allows you your character to jump and mantle over objects,
			and finally the circle button has you crouch but if you hold it 
			down you can go prone. The tab button of the controller brings up 
			the scoreboard showing how well (or poor) you, and your teammates 
			are performing in games. Finally, you can use the "d-pad" to call 
			in scorestreaks and such. For more information about the controls,
